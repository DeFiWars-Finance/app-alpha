# Smart Contract Audits

## Audits Performed

DeFiWars Finance's smart contract platform has been duly audited by prestigious
firms and developers, to ensure users' security while interacting with them.

Our ecosystem is based upon a master smart contract which bundles several others
to achieve WhitePaper's promises.

The following smart contracts have been thoroughly analyzed, tested, and even
audited to guarantee transparency at code level.
