      DeFiWars Finance is an NFT(Non-Fungible Token)-based GameFi ecosystem,
      comprised of multiple digital assets, where users can accrue value via
      impermanent-loss-free LPs (Liquidity Pools), as well as be able to stake,
      swap and claim/buy NFTs to increase their individual APY, using proprietary
      consensus algorithm ‘PoLP’ (Proof-of-Liquidity Provision). DeFiWars Finance
      works with 3 different fungible tokens: $DWARF (native and governance token),
      $DARTH (utility token), and $JEDI (utility token).
